# Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express

## Overview

Welcome to one of my practice repositories where I study and share my findings about Node.js.
The base code of this repo is based on a LinkedIn Learning course titled [Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-restful-apis-with-node-js-and-express/building-a-rest-api-with-node-and-express?autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5ade1c55498e39379949fb9c&u=78163626).
The author of the course is Emmanuel Henri.
Part of my studies involves following tutorials and courses I can find online that I think I will find useful to learn from.
I find these kind of study materials useful, especially when it involves popular technologies such as Node.js.
Before I jump into building bigger projects, I always like to go over easier demos to get a better feeling of what the technology is offering.
Emmanuel Henri's course is a great example of that kind of educational content. It offers a great overview of how to start building API's with Node.js and Express, combining both short-form lectures and code examples.
You can read my full review about Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, here on my [blog](https://medium.com/@gregoryszy/my-review-of-building-restful-apis-with-node-js-and-express-b20efccd1cd) on Medium.
You will see a lot of additional comments over the code. That is my way of taking notes, so I can solidify my understanding about what a specific line of code does and how does it relate to the whole project.
Over time you can expect me to add additional comments. I will also be adding some new examples while I continue to try different elements of Node.js.
I treat these types of repositories as a playground where I can test new framework features, learn more about how to properly use GitHub and practice my writing skills.

## Key Topics

Below are the topics that I have learned from following the Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express course and reviewing it's code examples. Whenever I make such lists I like to add questions that I can try to answer whenever I come back to this document:

- How to setup a local development environment using Node.js, MongoDB and Postman?
- How to create an initial server setup with Express?
- How to connect Node.js to a MongoDB database?
- How to create RESTful endpoints that support CRUD operations?
- How can Postman be used to test API's?
